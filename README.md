# monad-supply

I pulled this more or less verbatim from HaskellWiki:

  http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/New_monads/MonadSupply

I use this monad all the time, so I wanted it on Hackage for distribution
purposes. I added some stuff like a monoid instance and some helper functions.

Please let me know if there is any issue with the licensing or copyright -- I 
am assuming that because it appears on the HaskellWiki that it follows the 
Simple license found there, and that packaging it in this way is not a problem.
