# Supply Monad 

> A monad to support computations which consume values from a (possibly infinite) supply.

## Disclaimer

Please let me know if there is any issue with the licensing or copyright â€” I am assuming that, because the code appears on the HaskellWiki pages, it follows the [Simple license](https://wiki.haskell.org/HaskellWiki:Copyrights) found there, and that packaging it in this way is not a problem.

## About this library

I pulled this more or less verbatim from the HaskellWiki, since I wanted it on 
Hackage for distribution purposes:

  http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/New_monads/MonadSupply

Some stuff was added, like a monoid instance and various helper functions.
